# Mini 64K

This project is inspired by the Apple IIe. We're going to pretend we're living in an alternate 1977 universe, with more advanced technology.

## R1 Hardware

* CPU: 1 MHz
* Screen: 320x200 16-color (32 KB)
* RAM: 64 KB
* Disk: 360 KB
* Network: 300 Baud

Since it is 2025, we're going to make three technological leaps:
1. Your disk is magically an SSD (Magic!)
2. Phext Exists
3. Your CPU has superpowers (no emulation, just rate-limiting)

## Exocortical Integration

You can run up to 64,000 mini64K boxes on an 8-core/16-thread system.
