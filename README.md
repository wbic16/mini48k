# Mini 64K

This project is inspired by the Apple IIe. We're going to pretend we're living in an alternate 1977 universe, with more advanced technology. Your local computer is a `Host Node` capable of operating a small city's worth of compute.

## R1 Slice

* CPU: 1 MHz
* Screen: 320x200 16-color (32 KB)
* RAM: 48 KB (500 KB/sec)
* Disk: 3.6 MB (10 floppies) + 30 KB/sec
* Network: 1200 Baud

## Host Node

A 2024-class mid-range laptop computer (Intel or AMD) is capable of running about 200,000 R1 Slices.

* CPU: 200 GHz (see beebjit benchmarks)
* VRAM Buffer: 200,000 x 64,000 16-color - 6.4 GB
* 48 GB RAM (100 GB/sec)
* 700 GB Disk (6 GB/sec)
* Network: 240 Mbit/sec

## Host Network

With 5 host nodes, you can power a simulation of about 1 million Apple II class systems. That's the intention of this game - to help you build a network of millions of small-scale agents.
